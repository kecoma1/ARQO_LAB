Basically the reason why it works its because of the timing.
 1__2  3__

Instruction 1
.------
.------
Instruction 2

This is a clock cycle, What we are doing now is writing in the moment 2 in the register, at that moment the value
of the register we need is updated. In the moment 1 is when the instruction 2 (the one which is in the ID stage) takes the 
instruction from the ID register, and in the moment 3 is when the register EX-MEM register is updated with a value in the register, 
as we are updating it in the moment 2, the value is already written in the register when we write.

If the value is updated in the rising edge, the value would be updated in the moment 3, at that moment the 
Instruction EX register is being updated, so we are writing at the same time that we read, and that's not possible, the value
would not be the one we expect it to be in a real word development because writing is not something instantaneous.
